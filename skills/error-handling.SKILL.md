# Error handling

The envelope (ProblemDetails + `correlationId`) and status meanings are defined in
[docs/conventions.md](../docs/conventions.md#response-and-error-envelope). This skill is the procedure.

## Decision table — API (C#)

| Situation | Throw / return | Becomes | Real example |
|---|---|---|---|
| One or more request fields invalid | collect into `Dictionary<string, string[]>`, then `throw new RequestValidationException(errors)` | 400 `errors` | `CampaignService.CreateAsync` |
| Single-field problem | `throw new RequestValidationException(new Dictionary<string, string[]> { ["csv"] = ["CSV is empty."] })` (or a local `Invalid(...)` helper) | 400 | `ImportService.Invalid` |
| Record missing **or owned by someone else** | `throw new NotFoundException("Campaign not found.")` | 404 `detail` | `CampaignService.FindOwnedAsync` |
| Stale `expectedVersion` (checked by hand) | `throw new ConflictException("Campaign was changed elsewhere (now version 4). Reload before saving.")` | 409 | `CampaignService.UpdateAsync` |
| `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` on a user edit | catch around `SaveChangesAsync`, rethrow `ConflictException` | 409 | `OpportunityService.UpdateStatusAsync` |
| `DbUpdateException` from a unique index race | catch, rethrow `ConflictException` ("send it again") or recover | 409 | `ApplicationService.ReportAsync`, `ResearchService.QueueForOwnerAsync` (recovers by returning the active job) |
| Already done, cannot repeat | `ConflictException` | 409 | `ImportService.CommitAsync` (already committed) |
| Subject claim missing/not a GUID | `UnauthorizedAccessException` (thrown by `CurrentUser`) | 401 | `Api/Auth/CurrentUser.cs` |
| Agent key absent / unknown | `AuthenticateResult.NoResult()` / `AuthenticateResult.Fail(...)` in the handler | 401 | `AgentKeyAuthenticationHandler` |
| Domain invariant broken (caller bug) | `ArgumentException` / `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` / `InvalidOperationException` in the entity | 500, logged | `ResearchJob.Claim` |
| Outbound fetch fails | **return** `FetchResult.Fail("The site answered 404.", requests)` — never throw | source `Failed` + safe event | `SafeFetcher.FetchAsync` |
| A source cannot be read during research | record `SourceStatus.Failed` with a safe reason; the run continues and ends `CompletedWithGaps` | job state | `ResearchRunner.GatherAsync` |
| Unexpected error inside a research run | let it reach `RunNextAsync`; it logs, then `RecordFailureAsync` sets `Failed` with "reference {jobId}" | job `Failed` | `ResearchRunner.RunNextAsync` |
| Startup misconfiguration that is a security risk | `throw new InvalidOperationException(...)` at startup | process stops | `AuthSetup` (DevBypass outside Development) |
| Missing configuration that is not a security risk | `setup.DatabaseMissing(...)` / `setup.AuthMissing(...)` and fall back (demo mode) | capabilities report it | `Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs` |

Mapping lives in one place: `Api/Hosting/AppExceptionHandler.cs` (+ `AddProblemDetails` in `Program.cs` adding `correlationId`).
Adding a new exception type means adding a case there and a row to the table above.

## Steps for a new service method

1. Validate input first, all fields at once, with the entity's `Max…Length` constants in the messages.
2. Load through the owner-filtered query; missing → `NotFoundException` (same message whether absent or not owned).
3. Check `expectedVersion` → `ConflictException`.
4. Call the domain method (its guards are a last line of defence, not user validation).
5. Wrap `SaveChangesAsync` only where a concurrency or unique-index race is possible; translate to `ConflictException`.
6. Never catch anything else in services or controllers; `AppExceptionHandler` turns the rest into a logged 500.

## Messages

| Audience | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| End user (400/404/409, `SafeError`, research events) | plain sentence, what to do next, no internals | "Add at least one source before running research." |
| Logs | structured, ids and categories; exception object passed to `LogError` | `logger.LogError(ex, "Research job {JobId} stopped on an unexpected error", job.Id)` |
| 500 body | fixed text only | "The error was logged with the correlation id below." |

## Desktop agent (TypeScript)

| Situation | Do |
|---|---|
| Only the user can fix it (logged out, security check, platform limit, 3 failures in a row) | `throw new StopRun('…exact next step…')` |
| One job cannot be handled | return an `Outcome` (`Failed` with `captureDebug`, `NeedsManual`, `Skipped`); the run continues |
| API call fails | `call()` returns `{ ok: false, reason }`; the run keeps the result locally for `sync` |
| CLI command fails | throw `Error` with a user-actionable message; `main().catch` prints it and sets exit code 1 |

## Anti-patterns

- Never return 403 or a different message for "exists but not yours" — it leaks existence. Use `NotFoundException`.
- Never put `ex.Message`, stack traces, SQL, URLs with credentials, keys or connection strings in a response, `SafeError`, `ResearchEvent` or `Activity`.
- Never throw from `IWebFetcher` for network or policy failures, and never let one bad source fail the whole run.
- Never `try/catch` in a controller, and never swallow an exception without logging or recording a safe reason.
- Never use domain `ArgumentException`s as user validation (they become 500s).
- Never return `BadRequest(...)`/`NotFound()` objects from services; services throw the three application exceptions.
- Never turn a missing optional integration (no DB, no Supabase, no Gemini key) into a startup crash; report it through `SetupState`/capabilities. Only security guards stop the process.
- In the agent, never throw for a per-job failure, and never continue past a security check.
